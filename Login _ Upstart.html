Your current dollar won't stretch as far and you may have to make changes to your budget—as prices of goods go up, you may have to look for alternatives.

When inflation rises, consumers need to spend more money to buy the same goods and services. So, you can expect to pay more for goods and services than you normally would, as demand outpacing supply and shortages cause price spikes.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIt’s helpful to think about inflation in the context of the value of the United States dollar. As prices rise, each dollar you hold buys fewer goods and services. That’s what’s known as purchasing power—and as the purchasing power of your money declines, the cost of living goes up. It can be an opportune time to reassess your budget, plan to take out a personal loan, or talk to a financial advisor. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eEconomists often use the term basket of goods which refers to a fixed set of consumer goods or services, and these are the prices of which are used to measure inflation.
